# rust-fullstack-example
Example of Rust-Actix server with Rust-Seed frontend.

Seed Frontend from MartinKavik (https://github.com/MartinKavik/seed-rs-realworld)
Actix Server from fairingrey (https://github.com/fairingrey/actix-realworld-example-app)

Both built to conform to RealWorld Example (https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

Only edit to code is to set the API_URL to local destinations and to allow server to receive requests.

Currently, you will have to navigate in to each folder in order to start the applications
